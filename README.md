❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Web Application

🚀 A machine learning–powered web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical attributes.
This project is built using Logistic Regression for prediction and Django for deployment, with a modern HTML/CSS interface for a smooth user experience.


---

🔍 Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide.
This project aims to assist in early prediction of heart disease by analyzing multiple clinical parameters.
Users can input their health details, and the system predicts whether they are at risk of heart disease.


---

⚙️ Features

✅ User-Friendly Web Interface – Modern and responsive design built with HTML, CSS, and Django.
✅ Machine Learning Model – Logistic Regression trained on heart disease dataset.
✅ Real-Time Prediction – Instantly predicts the probability of having heart disease.
✅ Interactive Forms – Users enter medical attributes like age, BP, cholesterol, etc.
✅ Mobile-Friendly Access – Can be tested on both PC and mobile browser.
✅ Explainable Predictions – Provides insights based on key health parameters.

🧪 Input Features (User Parameters)

The following attributes are required from the user:

Age – Patient’s age in years

Sex – 1 = Male, 0 = Female

Chest Pain Type (cp) – Value from 0–3

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps) – Measured in mmHg

Cholesterol (chol) – Serum cholesterol in mg/dl

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs) – 1 if >120 mg/dl, else 0

Resting ECG (restecg) – Value from 0–2

Max Heart Rate (thalach) – Achieved maximum heart rate

Exercise Induced Angina (exang) – 1 = Yes, 0 = No

ST Depression (oldpeak) – Depression induced by exercise

Slope – Value from 0–2

Number of Major Vessels (ca) – Value from 0–3

Thalassemia (thal) – Value 3, 6, or 7
